Fixed bug that from 23:00 to 00:00 appropriate day/week/months/year csv were not updated.

If you want to correct the day/week/month/year csv files, remove till the earliest day from week/month from all the csv files, except year.csv file.

# [Added tool to read the smart_plug_mini.py generated csv files and write a summary for each device to a separate Google spreadsheet (R1.1.0)](https://github.com/ZuinigeRijder/python-broadlink-smart-plug-mini/releases/tag/R1.1.0) - 05 Feb 2023

Simple Python3 script to read the smart_plug_mini.py generated csv files and write a summary for each device to a separate Google spreadsheet.

Note: you need to install the package gspread and configure gspread

Usage:
```
python csv_to_google_sheet.py
```
INPUTFILES:
- smart_plug_mini.cfg
- for each configured DEVICE_NAME:
- - DEVICE_NAME.csv
- - DEVICE_NAME.days.csv
- - DEVICE_NAME.weeks.csv
- - DEVICE_NAME.months.csv
- - DEVICE_NAME.years.csv

Standard output:
- progress of what is done

OUTPUT SPREADSHEET:
- DEVICE_NAME.SP (for each configured DEVICE_NAME)

So the smart_plug_mini.py tool runs on my Raspberry Pi server, but I want to look at the results, without having to login to my server. So another tool has been made, which copies a summary to a google spreadsheet for each device: csv_to_google_sheet.py

The Google spreadsheet contains kWh usage, including nice diagrams, when you [import the example Badkamer.SP.xlsx spreadsheet in Google Spreadsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZuinigeRijder/python-broadlink-smart-plug-mini/main/examples/Badkamer.SP.xlsx):
- last written Date, Time, kWh, Hour, Day, Week, Month, Year
- last 48 hours
- last 32 days
- last 27 weeks
- last 25 months
- last 25 years ;-)

A short video of how it can look on an Android phone, [can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/p4IWoX7yNpE).
Of course you can also view the Google Spreadsheet on your computer or tablet, e.g. Windows or Mac.
